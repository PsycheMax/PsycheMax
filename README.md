I am currently building a multi-brand token-based Design System for a high-visibility italian client, one of the biggest private companies in Italy - operating acrossing the globe in the energy and renewable energy sector.
The main requirement for the Design System I'm building is interoperability across various front-end frameworks, specifically targeting React, Angular and Vue.
